# Shirts!
This year you can show your support for EightKB by purchasing some shirts from our [Bonfire Store](https://www.bonfire.com/store/eightkb/)! All proceeds will go toward covering costs for our Mixed Extents podcast and the EightKB conference. Since we are 100% self-funded and vendor free, we appreciate the support!

This event was created to fill a void in the SQL Server conference line-up. While there are many important topics to discuss and things to learn in the SQL Server world, we want this conference to focus on the core components of SQL Server, the things that make SQL Server work.
