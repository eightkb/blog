255172,Parallelism in Microsoft SQL Server,"SQL Server can execute queries in parallel which can sometimes improve the performance of your queries. However, parallelism has its own challenges; therefore, we will look at the concept of parallel executions to understand when it makes sense to run a query on more than one thread. We deal with topics such as CXPacket, threads, workers, execution context, branches, MAXDOP, Cost threshold for parallelism, NUMA nodes and the iterators that SQL Server can implement in the execution plan to enable parallelism.",Torsten Strauß,torsten.strauss@gmail.com,75m,400,9 Jun 2021 03:17 PM,9 Jun 2021 07:24 PM,Room 1,28 Jul 2021 01:00 PM,75,a91e5689-5e60-4b15-b891-565d1b384ae9,Torsten,Strauß,torsten.strauss@gmail.com,inside-sqlserver.com,"Torsten (MVP, MCSE, MCT) has been working with Microsoft SQL Server since the turn of the millennium and is specialized in performance optimization for large SQL Server environments.

253536,"""Black Arts"" Index Maintenance - GUIDs v.s. Fragmentation - They're not the problem... WE ARE!","This is NOT your typical presentation on the fragmentation problems of Random GUIDs.  No… Instead we’re going to DESTROY THE MYTH OF RANDOM GUID FRAGMENTATION.

In one of the most ironic/heterodoxical turns of knowledge you’re ever likely to experience, we’ll see how THE USE OF RANDOM GUIDS CAN ACTUALLY PREVENT FRAGMENTATION!  In the end, you’ll witness the results of some simple testing that clearly demonstrate that you can easily insert literally MILLIONs of rows into a Random GUID clustered index with almost no page splits (not even supposed “good” ones) and LESS THAN 1% Logical fragmentation!

We’ll identify the real problem and the seriously effective yet incredibly simple two-part fix for it.  In the process, we’ll prove that Random GUIDs actually behave in a manner like most people expect a good index to behave, especially in but not limited to high performance OLTP environments as well as the benefits of doing so.

We’ll also learn how to use a new tool that I created (included in the ZIP file) to ACTUALLY SEE what an index looks like at the page level for all pages in a single graph.

Then, we’ll use that tool to lay waste to what people are currently calling “Best Practice” index maintenance. We’ll literally see what REORGANIZE does to an index at the page level and why it’s one of the very worst things you can do to your Random GUID and many other types of indexes even if you’re limited to the Standard Edition of SQL Server.  We also prove that REORGANIZE CAUSES ORDERS-OF-MAGNITUDE WORSE TRANSACTION LOG FILE USAGE than REBUILD especially for Random GUIDs.

As interesting and totally necessary sidebars, we'll also see how the use of ever-increasing index keys could be (and frequently is) a major source of many of your fragmentation problems and we’ll also see that NEWSEQUENTIALID may NOT the answer that you’re looking for.",Jeff Moden,jbmoden@ameritech.net,75m,8192,9 Jun 2021 03:17 PM,9 Jun 2021 03:24 PM,Room 1,28 Jul 2021 02:30 PM,75,51ba13d4-7d81-48cd-bcb6-24ef2342f939,Jeff,Moden,jbmoden@ameritech.net,Performance is in the code.,"Jeff Moden is an “Accidental DBA” with more than two decades of SQL Server experience.

253275,How does SQL Server store that data type?,"If you've ever been curious about how each data type looks on your storage subsystem, this is the session for you. We'll step through each data type, and how the hex looks at the storage layer.

You will understand why certain data types are better choices than others. I'll show you a few surprises, and settle an old score with DATETIME.

Breaking out the hex editor might automatically qualify this as a 500-level session depending on your appetite for nerdy goodness, plus you should be able to use this information for data recovery (like I have).",Randolph West,r@ndolph.ca,75m,500,9 Jun 2021 03:17 PM,9 Jun 2021 04:17 PM,Room 1,28 Jul 2021 04:00 PM,75,871c896a-63e5-4d48-b612-85b8b11f8499,Randolph,West,r@ndolph.ca,Born SQL,"Randolph West (they/them) is a Microsoft Data Platform MVP, and has worked with SQL Server since the late 1990s.
