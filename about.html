                <p><span class="nameF">eight</span><span class="nameS">kb</span> was created to fill a void in the SQL Server conference line-up. While there are many important topics to discuss and things to learn in the SQL Server world, we felt that not enough time was being spent on the core components, the things that make SQL Server work.</p>
                <p>This conference was born during uncertain times, and came about from a chat conversation between Andrew Pruski and Mark Wilkinson. From there we brought on the help of Anthony Nocentino, and before all is said an done, I'm sure others will join the team.</p>
                <h2>Andrew Pruski</h2>
                <p>SQL Server DBA and Microsoft Data Platform MVP, originally from Wales but now exploring Ireland. I have been working with relational databases (in one form or another) for over 10 years and have a real passion for the technology.</p>

                <p>The online SQL Server community has helped me out immensely throughout my career, whether from providing reference material in blog posts, or answering my (sometimes obscure) questions on forums. So, to try and say thank you, I would like to contribute my own experiences in the hope that they could benefit someone out there.</p>
